       jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library.
       The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
       jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.
       jQuery also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
       The jQuery library contains the following features:
       HTML/DOM manipulation
       CSS manipulation
       HTML event methods
       Effects and animations
       AJAX
       Utilities
