    â€¢ What is Components in React Js?


      
     In React.js, components are the building blocks of user interfaces.
     They are reusable, self-contained pieces of code that encapsulate the logic,
     behavior, and UI elements of a specific part of a web application. Components allow developers to break down complex user interfaces into smaller, manageable pieces, making it easier to develop and maintain applications.

     

     1 Functional Components 
     
     (Stateless Components): These components are typically defined as JavaScript functions and 
     only receive props (properties) as input and return JSX (React's syntax extension for JavaScript) to describe 
     what should be rendered on the screen. Functional components are used for simpler components that don't need to maintain their own state or have lifecycle methods.
   

     2 Class Components:

      These components are defined as ES6 classes and can maintain their own internal state,
       in addition to receiving props. Class components are used for more complex components that need to
        manage state or use lifecycle methods.
