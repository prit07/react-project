   How to change in components of React Js?


   1 Identify the Component:
     First, identify the component you want to change.
     It can be an existing component within your project, or you may create a 
     new one if needed.

   2 Locate the Component Code:
     Locate the component code in your project.
     Components are typically defined in separate .
     js files, each representing a different component.

   3 Make the Changes:
     Edit the component's code to make the desired changes.
     You can modify the component's structure, behavior,
     or styling based on your requirements.

   4 Save the Changes:
      Save the changes you made to the component file.

   5 Check for Errors:
      After making the changes, check the console in your development environment
      (such as the browser console) for any errors that might have occurred due to 
      the changes you made. If there are errors, review the changes and fix them.

   6 Test the Changes:
      Run your React.js application and test the changes you made to the component. 
      Interact with the application to ensure that the component functions as expected.
      
   7 Commit Changes (if using version control):
      If your project is under version control (e.g., Git), commit the changes you made to the component. 
      This allows you to keep track of the changes and revert them if needed.
