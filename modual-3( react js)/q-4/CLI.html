   What is CLI command In React Js?
    

   In React.js, the term "CLI command" refers to commands that you run in the command-line interface (CLI) to perform various tasks related to React application development. These commands are provided by tools like Create React App (CRA) or other React project templates, and they streamline the development process by automating common tasks.

Create React App (CRA) is a popular CLI tool developed by Facebook that sets up a pre-configured React development environment with all the necessary build tools and configurations. It allows developers to quickly create and scaffold a new React project without having to configure the build tools manually. Here are some common CLI commands you can use with Create React App:

1. **Create a New React Project:**
   ```
   npx create-react-app my-app
   ```
   This command initializes a new React project named `my-app` in a directory with the same name. It sets up the necessary folder structure and configuration files for the React application.

2. **Start Development Server:**
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This command starts the development server and opens the React application in your default web browser. The development server supports hot reloading, meaning any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh the application in the browser.

3. **Build the Production Version:**
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   This command builds the production version of the React application. It generates optimized and minified files in the `build` directory, which can be deployed to a web server for production use.

4. **Run Tests:**
   ```
   npm test
   ```
   This command runs the test suites associated with the React application. Create React App uses Jest as the default testing framework.

5. **Eject (Advanced):**
   ```
   npm run eject
   ```
   This command "ejects" the configuration from Create React App, exposing all the build and configuration files. Ejecting is a one-way operation, and once you eject, you cannot go back. It is recommended to use this command only if you need to customize the build configuration.

Please note that the actual CLI commands may vary depending on the specific tool or template you are using for your React project. Apart from Create React App, other React-related tools may also provide their own CLI commands for specific tasks, such as testing, code formatting, linting, and more.

Before running any CLI commands, ensure that you have Node.js and NPM (Node Package Manager) installed on your system and that you are running the commands from the root directory of your React project.
