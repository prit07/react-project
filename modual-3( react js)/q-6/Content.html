     serve specific purposes in the structure of a web application.

     Header Component:
      
     The Header component is typically used to create the top section of a web page or application.
      It often contains branding elements such as the logo or site name, navigation menus, and sometimes
       additional information like a search bar or user profile links.
     The Header component remains consistent across different pages of the application and provides users with a way to easily access important functionalities.
