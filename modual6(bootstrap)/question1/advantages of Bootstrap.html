<!-- What are the advantages of Bootstrap?
      

      Having a website is a prerequisite for every small and big business. 
      But having stylish and efficient websites designed in a small time frame is the need of the hour. 
      Due to this reason, User Interface (UI) designers and web designers choose to take up code reusability.
      With this, the same HTML code is used for website projects, saving time and effort.
       The proponents in such backdrop are the UI frameworks, and the key player amid this is Bootstrap. 
       The varied advantages of Bootstrap make it one of the most popular among developers.
       Besides, it is an open-source toolkit that helps develop UI using CSS, HTML, and JS.
