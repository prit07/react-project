    • What is Redux?

    Well, an application has its state, which can be a combination of
    the states of its internal components.

    Let's take an e-commerce website for example. 
    An e-commerce website will have several components like the cart component,
    user profile component, previously viewed section component, and so on.

    We'll take the cart component which displays the number of items in a user's cart.
    The state of the cart component will consist of all the items the user has added to the cart and the total number of those items.
    At all times the application is up and running, this component has to show the updated number of items in the user's cart
