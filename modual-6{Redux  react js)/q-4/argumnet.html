• What is the second argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is
  its purpose?

  In the context of programming and React.js, the `setState` function is used to update the state of a component and trigger a re-rendering of the component with the updated state. The `setState` function takes two arguments:

1. The first argument is an object or a function that represents the new state values you want to set.

2. The second argument (optional) is a callback function that will be executed after the state has been updated and the component has been re-rendered.

The purpose of the optional second argument, which is a callback function, is to perform additional operations that depend on the updated state or the component's re-rendering. It allows you to execute code that needs to run immediately after the state has been updated and the component is reflecting the new state. This is particularly useful when you have some logic that relies on the updated state and needs to be executed in the same render cycle.

Here's an example of how `setState` can be used with the optional second argument:
